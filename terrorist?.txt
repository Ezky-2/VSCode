So
خب
we must ask ourselves
ما باید از خودمون بپرسیم

what is the dictionary definition of Terrorism?
معنی مغتی تروریست چیه؟

"The systematic use of terror, especially as a means of coercion"

But what is terror?

According to the dictionary I hold in my hand
با توجه به لغتنامه ای که توی دستم دارم

"Terror is violent or destructive acts
ترور اعمال خشونت آمیز یا مخرب است

such as bombing
مانند بمب گذاری

Committed by groups in order to intimidate a population
توسط گروه ها به منظور کنترل کردن یک جامع انجام می شود

Or government into granting their demands"
